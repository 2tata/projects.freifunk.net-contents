question: "I found a great project! How can I contact my mentor?"
---
We act as an umbrella organization, so there's a bunch of possibilities to contact mentors.

If you're in doubt or don't know the project location, ask at [irc](http://irc.freifunk.net) or our [international Mailinglist](https://lists.freifunk.net/mailman/listinfo/wlanware-freifunk.net).
