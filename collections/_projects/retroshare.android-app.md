Retroshare already has an android app that has the function of create a simple chat 
app using GXS tunnels. 

The application is in a early stage and can have lots of improvements, from the
UI, chat features, porting to the new JSON API or Android integration, and to
make it more modern and user friendly.
And maybe use more modern libraries as [Kirigami](https://www.kde.org/products/kirigami/).

#### Milestones

* Implement better UI
* Improve key exchange
* Implement new chat features based on JSON API capabilities
* Improve Android integration (as data usage and more)

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* get familiar with the Retroshare API
* discuss possible options with the developers
