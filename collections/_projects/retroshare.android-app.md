Retroshare already has an android app that has the function of create a simple chat 
app using GXS tunnels. 

Unfortunately, the application is in a early stage and can have lots of 
improvements, from the UI, chat features or Android integration, trying to make it more modern and 
user friendly. And maybe use more modern libraries as [Kirigami](https://www.kde.org/products/kirigami/).

#### Milestones

* Implement better UI
* Improve key exchange
* Implement new chat features based on API capabilities
* Improve Android integration (as data usage and more)

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* get familiar with the Retroshare API
* discuss possible options with the developers
