Most of user-input texts in the Retroshare software are supplied to the backend
as HTML by Qt. Although it offers a lot of possibilities, it is also a double
weakness both in terms of security and CPU-efficiency. The plan is therefore to
implement a markup language (ex. a subset of AsciiDoc) translation which would
ensure that a only minimal set of features can be represented and displayed
(namely emoticons, links, images, font-style (bold, italic...).

Retroshare should accept markup text to be displayed and convert it internally
into proper HTML that Qt will understand Allow the user to get the markup text
generated by the widget.  Possibly ensure some minimal backward compatibility
with the existing data.

#### Milestones
* define the list of features we want to be handled by the markup language
* define a new text editing widget/component that has the needed buttons and options to handle markup text (e.g. link and image insertion).
* implement an approximate conversion of existing html into this language for backward compatibility

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* get familiar with the Retroshare network 
* understand how text is supplied by users and converted into html
* discuss possible options with the developers
