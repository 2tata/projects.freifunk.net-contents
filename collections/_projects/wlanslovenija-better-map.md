Currently nodewatcher uses very simple node map which is not so helpful when managing and monitoring city or country wide network. It would be great if nodewatcher mep would show online and offline nodes per project and show recently added or disconnected nodes. This feature would make map a much useful tool for managing our networks.

Student should have experience or be willing to learn Python and Django and leaflet.js and how to write Django apps together with basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript and general web development. Understanding of leaflet.js is a plus.

#### Milestones

* Learn about the nodewatcher and its api system.
* Discuss and suggest UI/UX elements that would make map more readable.
* Deploy new map on staging server.
* Document new map features.
* Deploy new map on production server.
