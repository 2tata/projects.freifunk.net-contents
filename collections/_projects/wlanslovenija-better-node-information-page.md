Currently nodewatcher node information page shows too much information, which is especially overwhelming for new users. Node information page should be informative but also readable and easily understood by users. Also if someone wishes to see more information then all collected statistic should be available when needed.

* Analyse current node information page and discuss ideas on how to make it more readable.
* Discuss and suggest UI/UX elements that would make page more readable.
* Deploy new node information page on staging server.
* Ask users for early feedback.
* Document development process and new features.
* Deploy new node information page on production server.
